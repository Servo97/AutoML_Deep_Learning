# Structured Deep Learning for Big Cyber-Security Datasets

Pipeline for running hyperparameter optimization over structured deep learning code. Normal Fully Connected Layers can be build with varying depth and parameters. 

Optuna can be used to perform hyperparameter optimization over the entire dataset. Resulting best model can be compared with Amazon's AutoGluon. 

Datasets Used:
* CICIDS 2017: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html
* CICIDS 2018: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html
* KDD security dataset: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html
